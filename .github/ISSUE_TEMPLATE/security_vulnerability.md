# STOP - DO NOT USE THIS TEMPLATE

**Security vulnerabilities should NOT be reported as public GitHub issues.**

Please report security vulnerabilities privately via email to:

**security@subcode.ventures**

Include the following information in your email:

1. **Description**: What is the vulnerability?
2. **Impact**: What could an attacker do with this?
3. **Steps to Reproduce**: How can we reproduce the issue?
4. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas on how to fix it
5. **Your Contact Info**: So we can follow up with you

## Why Private Reporting?

Public disclosure of security vulnerabilities before a patch is available puts all Sentinel users at risk. By reporting privately, you help us:

- Develop and test a fix
- Notify affected users
- Coordinate responsible disclosure
- Credit you for the discovery (if desired)

## Response Timeline

- Acknowledgment within 48 hours
- Fix for critical issues within 7 days
- Regular updates on progress

Thank you for helping keep Sentinel secure!
